    <h2> Part 1: INTRODUCTION </h2>

    <p>	<a href="https://smpl.org/">Santa Monica Public Library Website</a> is the information hub for the library which serves the town of Santa Monica. The library began in November of 1890 with a donation of 800 books. Since that time the library has grown into a network of five locations with over 400,000 volumes in their collections. Santa Monica Public Library has a wide scope targeted towards people of all ages. The library site states that they “ engage in a lively online presence” (Santa Monica Public Library, n.d.) and this robust online presence is reflected in the content on the library’s website. </p>
    <p>Upon first entering the homepage of the site, the user is confronted with a massive amount of information and navigation. However, at first glance the site is deceptively simple. It contains the usual amount of menu bars with a search bar at the top of the site. But upon clicking on one button the user realizes that there are two separate menu bars with different information, one vertical and one horizontal. The horizontal menu bar contains eight buttons and each button has a page with numerous vertical button options, ranging from five all the way up to eleven options. </p>
<p>Organizing this amount of content in one website is quite a challenge and creates an issue of managing the complexity of the information. The law of user experience which I have chosen to evaluate this site is Teslar’s Law, otherwise known as the Law of Conservation of Complexity to determine whether or not Santa Monica Public Library Website has created a website which honors this law and creates a great experience for the user. </p>

<h2>Part 2: LITERATURE REVIEW</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Teslar’s Law, also known as “The Law of Conservation of Complexity, states that for any system there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced” (Young & Rossmann, 2015). Created by Larry Teslar this law has applications which extend well beyond user experience. It is viewed as “an adage in human–computer interaction” (Law of Conservation of Complexity, 2020), but there is much to be learned and applied from this law when considering the design of a website with the user in mind. User experience is “a perception of a person and his response to the use of a system, product, and service” (Mina Rofida Rahmatina & Ratnasari, 2022). This process of interactions will result in the total experience of the user. When applying Teslars’s Law to user experience three key considerations are important to enhance the user’s experience:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Complexity cannot be removed.</li>
    <li>The burden of complexity should be taken away from the user.</li>
    <li>Do not attempt to oversimplify.</li>
</ol>
Combining these three aspects gives a well-rounded approach to applying Teslar’s Law in user experience. </p>

<h3>Complexity Cannot Be Removed</h3>
<p> The first key consideration of Teslar’s Law is that  all processes have a core of complexity that cannot be designed away and therefore must be assumed by either the system or the user. The complexity of a system “just doesn’t go away. Every decision to add a control, even a simple button, increases the complexity of a device” (Saffer, 2016). Reducing the complexity results in reducing the control, and it is essential to keep the user’s needs in mind whenever a decision is made to remove control in the design.</p>

<h3>Take The Burden Away From the User</h3>
<p>The next key consideration in implementing Teslar’s Law is to ensure that as much as possible of the burden is lifted from users by dealing with inherent complexity during design and development. What this means is to decide how complex the design must be, and then to use thoughtful design to create a site in which the user has the “best possible user experience” (Tesler’s Law | Uxtoast, 2022). Some ways to achieve this are to provide “flexible and fluid pathways” (Experience, 2020) in the design. This can be done by providing “methods that allow for skipping ahead, looping back to an earlier step, and moving fluidly from any step to any other” (Experience, 2020). Reducing clutter in the site and providing a concise dashboard for the site also help to take the burden of complexity away from the user. </p>

<h3>Do Not Oversimplify</h3>
<p>The third and final key consideration in implementing Teslar’s Law is to take care not to simplify interfaces to the point of abstraction. Eliminating complexity is important but simplifying too much creates the risk of losing essential  information. Yablonski (2020) states that designers must become “elegant simplifiers.” Striking the balance between simplicity and complexity is the key to successfully implementing Teslar’s Law. </p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>
    Creating the best possible experience for the user is very important to the success of a website. When considering how to create a great experience for the user it is important to keep in mind because “ it relates to a fundamental challenge faced throughout our work: how we manage complexity”  (Yablonski, 2020). Retaining the essential complexity of a system without oversimplifying and using targeted design techniques to take the burden of complexity away from the user are ways to handle this challenge. Teslar’s Law is an important consideration for designers and is one that should be implemented from the beginning of the design process all the way through to the implementation and evaluation.  </p>

<h2>Part 3: ANALYSIS</h2>
<p>When evaluating the Santa Monica Library Website for usability and adherence to the law of conservation of complexity it appears that an attempt was made to manage the complexity of the massive amount of information contained in the site. As a user, when I first attempted to navigate the site I was somewhat confused and overwhelmed by the navigation. </p>

<p>The home page of the site seems simple enough with just a horizontal top menu bar. But when you click on one of the buttons a vertical menu bar appears for each page which adds between five and eleven more pages. Having each top menu button contain so much information is a lot for the user to handle. However, the designers did make an attempt to manage this by keeping the menu bar constant on each page. The top bar contains the items:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reopening </li>
        <li>Online Library</li>
        <li>Books, Music, Movies</li>
        <li>Programs</li>
        <li>Research </li>
        <li>Services</li>
        <li>About Us </li>
    </ul>  
    <!-- <h2>Website Image</h2> -->
   
    <img src="smpl hompage.png" alt= "SMPL Homepage">


    <p>Within each of those pages the side menu changes and adds the five to eleven pages of more information. The designers managed this complexity by keeping the top menu constant and having the side menu change with navigation.</p>

    <!-- <h2>Website Image</h2> -->
<img src="smpl vertical bar.png" alt= "SMPL vertical menu">

<p> For the user this amount of information is overwhelming. However, if all of this information is essential then there has to be a way to organize it and the designers did make an attempt at addressing the organization of the content. Still, as a user of the site I did feel overwhelmed initially which leaves me with the conclusion that more care could have been taken in the design in order to manage the complexity of information contained within the site. </p>

<h2>Part 4: RECOMMENDATIONS </h2>

<p>In order to adhere to Teslar’s Law of conservation of complexity my key recommendation would be to attempt to simplify the site. The amount of information is overwhelming for the user and there are too many pages to navigate. </p>

<p>The designers and stakeholders should work together to reduce and consolidate the information into fewer pages. Reducing the amount of pages creates less clutter and less confusion as a user tries to find information on the site and complete tasks. </p>

<p>Another recommendation would be to remove the vertical menu bar. Taking this menu bar out  has the potential of reducing information overload because of the confusion which occurs when navigating from the top horizontal menu bar and having that vertical bar appear with completely different information on each page. I think that the format of the home page could be replicated and just have the information on the page without the side menu bar. This would simplify the design and reduce the amount of information on the pages. 
</p>

<p>Streamlining the information and working to reduce unnecessary pages and complexity has the potential to maximize the user’s experience of the site and have a positive impact on the overall design and usability of this library’s central website.</p>
